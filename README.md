# Detect_Facial_Expressions
This project is  a real-time emotion recognition system that captures a user's facial expressions through a webcam, identifies the emotion, and displays the corresponding emoji. The system leverages deep learning techniques for emotion detection and integrates with a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
